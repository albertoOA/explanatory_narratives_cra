·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan B' is plan with more tasks than 'Plan A', which is cheaper plan than and is plan with less tasks than and is faster plan than and is better plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 2 grasp object', which directly precedes 'task 3 goto waypoint', and also includes task 'task 3 goto waypoint', which directly precedes 'task 5 give object', and also includes task 'task 5 give object'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 2 goto waypoint', which directly precedes 'task 5 goto waypoint', and also includes task 'task 3 grasp object', which directly precedes 'task 4 goto waypoint', and also includes task 'task 5 goto waypoint' and 'task 6 goto waypoint', which directly precedes 'task 7 give object', and also includes task 'task 7 give object'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has value '27.0' and has a lower value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan', which has value '59.0'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has value '6.0' and has a lower value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks', which has value '8.0'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has value '27.0' and has a lower value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost', which has value '59.0'.
