·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan B' is plan with equal number of tasks than 'Plan A', which is more expensive plan than and is plan with equal number of tasks than and is slower plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 0 navigate' and 'task 1 navigate' and 'task 2 calibrate' and 'task 3 calibrate' and 'task 4 sample soil' and 'task 5 take image' and 'task 6 take image' and 'task 8 calibrate' and 'task 9 take image' and 'task 10 navigate' and 'task 13 drop' and 'task 14 communicate image data' and 'task 15 sample rock' and 'task 16 sample soil' and 'task 17 navigate' and 'task 18 drop' and 'task 19 navigate' and 'task 21 navigate' and 'task 22 communicate soil data' and 'task 24 communicate soil data' and 'task 26 communicate image data' and 'task 27 communicate soil data' and 'task 28 communicate rock data' and 'task 29 navigate' and 'task 30 sample rock' and 'task 32 drop' and 'task 33 communicate rock data' and 'task 34 navigate' and 'task 35 navigate' and 'task 36 sample rock'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 sample soil' and 'task 1 calibrate' and 'task 2 navigate' and 'task 3 navigate' and 'task 4 take image' and 'task 5 navigate' and 'task 6 sample rock' and 'task 8 navigate' and 'task 9 drop' and 'task 10 sample soil' and 'task 13 communicate soil data' and 'task 14 navigate' and 'task 15 navigate' and 'task 16 drop' and 'task 17 take image' and 'task 18 calibrate' and 'task 19 communicate image data' and 'task 21 take image' and 'task 22 navigate' and 'task 24 communicate image data' and 'task 26 navigate' and 'task 27 communicate image data' and 'task 28 navigate' and 'task 29 communicate soil data' and 'task 30 navigate' and 'task 32 communicate soil data' and 'task 33 navigate' and 'task 34 sample rock' and 'task 35 communicate rock data' and 'task 36 navigate'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'.
