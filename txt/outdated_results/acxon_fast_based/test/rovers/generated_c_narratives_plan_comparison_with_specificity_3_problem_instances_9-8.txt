·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B.

while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 sample soil', which directly precedes 'task 8 navigate' and 'task 9 drop' and 'task 10 sample soil', and also includes task 'task 1 calibrate', which directly precedes 'task 4 take image' and 'task 5 navigate' and 'task 6 sample rock', and also includes task 'task 2 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 4 take image' and 'task 5 navigate' and 'task 6 sample rock', and also includes task 'task 3 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 4 take image' and 'task 5 navigate' and 'task 6 sample rock', and also includes task 'task 4 take image', which directly precedes 'task 11 navigate', and also includes task 'task 5 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 8 navigate' and 'task 9 drop' and 'task 10 sample soil', and also includes task 'task 6 sample rock', which directly precedes 'task 12 navigate', and also includes task 'task 8 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 13 communicate soil data', and also includes task 'task 9 drop' and 'task 10 sample soil', which directly precedes 'task 16 drop', and also includes task 'task 13 communicate soil data', which directly precedes 'task 20 navigate' and 'task 19 communicate image data', and also includes task 'task 14 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 17 take image', and also includes task 'task 15 navigate' and 'task 16 drop' and 'task 17 take image', which directly precedes 'task 21 take image', and also includes task 'task 18 calibrate', which directly precedes 'task 21 take image', and also includes task 'task 19 communicate image data', which directly precedes 'task 24 communicate image data', and also includes task 'task 21 take image' and 'task 22 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 23 sample soil', and also includes task 'task 24 communicate image data', which directly precedes 'task 27 communicate image data' and 'task 28 navigate', and also includes task 'task 26 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 27 communicate image data' and 'task 28 navigate', and also includes task 'task 27 communicate image data', which directly precedes 'task 29 communicate soil data' and 'task 30 navigate', and also includes task 'task 28 navigate' and 'task 29 communicate soil data' and 'task 30 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 31 navigate', and also includes task 'task 32 communicate soil data', which directly precedes 'task 35 communicate rock data', and also includes task 'task 33 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 34 sample rock', and also includes task 'task 34 sample rock', which directly precedes 'task 36 navigate', and also includes task 'task 35 communicate rock data', which directly precedes 'task 37 communicate rock data', and also includes task 'task 36 navigate'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has value '146.01' and has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan', which has value '110.01'.
