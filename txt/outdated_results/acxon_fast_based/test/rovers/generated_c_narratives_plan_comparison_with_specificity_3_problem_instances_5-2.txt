·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan B' is plan with less tasks than 'Plan A', which is more expensive plan than and is plan with more tasks than and is slower plan than and is worse plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 1 sample rock', which directly precedes 'task 6 drop', and also includes task 'task 2 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 3 take image' and 'task 4 navigate', and also includes task 'task 3 take image', which directly precedes 'task 8 communicate image data' and 'task 9 take image', and also includes task 'task 4 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 7 sample soil', and also includes task 'task 5 calibrate', which directly precedes 'task 8 communicate image data' and 'task 9 take image', and also includes task 'task 6 drop' and 'task 7 sample soil', which directly precedes 'task 12 navigate' and 'task 13 drop', and also includes task 'task 8 communicate image data', which directly precedes 'task 15 communicate image data', and also includes task 'task 9 take image', which directly precedes 'task 11 take image', and also includes task 'task 10 calibrate', which directly precedes 'task 11 take image', and also includes task 'task 11 take image' and 'task 12 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 14 navigate', and also includes task 'task 13 drop' and 'task 14 navigate' and 'task 15 communicate image data', which directly precedes 'task 16 communicate image data', and also includes task 'task 16 communicate image data', which directly precedes 'task 17 communicate rock data', and also includes task 'task 17 communicate rock data', which directly precedes 'task 18 navigate', and also includes task 'task 18 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 19 sample rock', and also includes task 'task 19 sample rock', which directly precedes 'task 20 navigate', and also includes task 'task 20 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 21 communicate rock data', and also includes task 'task 21 communicate rock data', which directly precedes 'task 22 communicate soil data', and also includes task 'task 22 communicate soil data', which directly precedes 'task 23 navigate', and also includes task 'task 23 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 24 sample soil', and also includes task 'task 24 sample soil', which directly precedes 'task 25 navigate', and also includes task 'task 25 navigate', which directly precedes 'task 26 communicate soil data', and also includes task 'task 26 communicate soil data'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 1 sample soil', which directly precedes 'task 3 drop', and also includes task 'task 2 take image', which directly precedes 'task 5 communicate image data', and also includes task 'task 3 drop', which directly precedes 'task 4 sample rock', and also includes task 'task 4 sample rock' and 'task 5 communicate image data', which directly precedes 'task 6 communicate soil data', and also includes task 'task 6 communicate soil data', which directly precedes 'task 7 communicate rock data', and also includes task 'task 7 communicate rock data'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has value '135.01' and has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan', which has value '47.0'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has value '27.0' and has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks', which has value '8.0'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has value '135.01' and has a higher value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost', which has value '47.0'.
