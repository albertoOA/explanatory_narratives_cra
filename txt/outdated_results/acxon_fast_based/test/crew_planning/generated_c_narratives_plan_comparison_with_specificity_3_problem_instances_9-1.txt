while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 initialize day' and 'task 1 post sleep', which directly precedes 'task 2 have meal', and also includes task 'task 2 have meal', which directly precedes 'task 3 exercise', and also includes task 'task 3 exercise', which directly precedes 'task 4 change filter', and also includes task 'task 4 change filter', which directly precedes 'task 5 first reconfigurate thermal loops', and also includes task 'task 5 first reconfigurate thermal loops', which directly precedes 'task 6 remove sleep station', and also includes task 'task 6 remove sleep station', which directly precedes 'task 7 replace rpcm', and also includes task 'task 7 replace rpcm', which directly precedes 'task 8 assemble sleep station', and also includes task 'task 8 assemble sleep station', which directly precedes 'task 9 second reconfigurate thermal loops', and also includes task 'task 9 second reconfigurate thermal loops', which directly precedes 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 finish rpcm', and also includes task 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 finish rpcm'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has value '975.0' and has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan', which has value '796.01'.
