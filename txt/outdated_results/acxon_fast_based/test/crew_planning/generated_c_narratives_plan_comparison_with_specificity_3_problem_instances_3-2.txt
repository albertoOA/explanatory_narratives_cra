·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan B' is plan with equal cost than and is plan with more tasks than 'Plan A', which is plan with equal cost than and is plan with less tasks than and is slower plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 4 change filter', which directly precedes 'task 5 first reconfigurate thermal loops', and also includes task 'task 5 first reconfigurate thermal loops', which directly precedes 'task 6 remove sleep station', and also includes task 'task 6 remove sleep station', which directly precedes 'task 7 replace rpcm', and also includes task 'task 7 replace rpcm', which directly precedes 'task 8 assemble sleep station', and also includes task 'task 8 assemble sleep station', which directly precedes 'task 9 second reconfigurate thermal loops', and also includes task 'task 9 second reconfigurate thermal loops', which directly precedes 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 finish rpcm', and also includes task 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 finish rpcm'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 4 medical conference', which directly precedes 'task 5 conduct payload activity', and also includes task 'task 5 conduct payload activity', which directly precedes 'task 6 conduct payload activity' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline', and also includes task 'task 6 conduct payload activity', which directly precedes 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline', and also includes task 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity', which directly precedes 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline', and also includes task 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 conduct payload activity', which directly precedes 'task 12 sleep' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline', and also includes task 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 12 sleep' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has value '796.01' and has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan', which has value '616.01'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has value '12.0'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan A number of tasks' and has value '14.0'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has the same value as 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'.
