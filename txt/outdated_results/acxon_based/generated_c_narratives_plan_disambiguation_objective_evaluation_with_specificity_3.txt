·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is more expensive plan than and is plan with more tasks than and is slower plan than Plan_B. Plan_A includes task task_2_goto_waypoint, which directly precedes task_5_goto_waypoint, and also includes task task_3_grasp_object, which directly precedes task_4_goto_waypoint, and also includes task task_5_goto_waypoint and task_6_goto_waypoint, which directly precedes task_7_give_object, and also includes task task_7_give_object; while Plan_B includes task task_2_grasp_object, which directly precedes task_3_goto_waypoint, and also includes task task_3_goto_waypoint, which directly precedes task_5_give_object, and also includes task task_5_give_object. Plan_A has expected makespan Plan_A_makespan, which has a higher value than Plan_B_makespan and has value 59.0; while Plan_B has expected makespan Plan_B_makespan, which has value 27.0. Plan_A has number of tasks Plan_A_number_of_tasks, which has a higher value than Plan_B_number_of_tasks and has value 8.0; while Plan_B has number of tasks Plan_B_number_of_tasks, which has value 6.0. Plan_A has cost Plan_A_cost, which has a higher value than Plan_B_cost and has value 59.0; while Plan_B has cost Plan_B_cost, which has value 27.0.
