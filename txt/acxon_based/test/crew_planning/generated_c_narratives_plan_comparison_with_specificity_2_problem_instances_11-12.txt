'Plan A' is cheaper plan than and is shorter plan than and is faster plan than and is better plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 5 have meal' and 'task 6 have meal' and 'task 8 exercise' and 'task 11 sleep' and 'task 12 medical conference' and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 19 conduct payload activity' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' and 'task 22 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 25 conduct payload activity' and 'task 26 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 27 conduct payload activity' and 'task 28 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 29 conduct payload activity' and 'task 30 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 31 conduct payload activity' and 'task 32 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 33 conduct payload activity' and 'task 34 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 35 conduct payload activity' and 'task 38 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 40 first reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 41 remove sleep station' and 'task 42 replace rpcm' and 'task 43 assemble sleep station' and 'task 44 second reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 45 sleep' and 'task 46 finish rpcm'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 5 exercise' and 'task 6 sleep' and 'task 8 have meal' and 'task 11 have meal' and 'task 12 change filter' and 'task 14 medical conference' and 'task 16 conduct payload activity' and 'task 17 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 18 conduct payload activity' and 'task 19 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 24 conduct payload activity' and 'task 25 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 26 conduct payload activity' and 'task 27 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 28 conduct payload activity' and 'task 29 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 30 conduct payload activity' and 'task 31 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 32 conduct payload activity' and 'task 33 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 34 conduct payload activity' and 'task 35 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 38 conduct payload activity' and 'task 40 post sleep' and 'task 41 conduct payload activity' and 'task 42 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 43 conduct payload activity' and 'task 44 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 45 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 46 conduct payload activity' and 'task 47 first reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 48 sleep' and 'task 49 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 50 post sleep' and 'task 51 remove sleep station' and 'task 52 replace rpcm' and 'task 53 assemble sleep station' and 'task 54 second reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 55 finish rpcm'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'.
