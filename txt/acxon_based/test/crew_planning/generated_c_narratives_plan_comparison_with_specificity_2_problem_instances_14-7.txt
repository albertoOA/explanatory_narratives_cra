'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is longer plan than and is slower plan than and is worse plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 1 post sleep' and 'task 2 initialize day' and 'task 3 conduct payload activity' and 'task 4 conduct payload activity' and 'task 5 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 6 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 8 have meal' and 'task 9 exercise' and 'task 10 change filter' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 13 conduct payload activity' and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' and 'task 18 conduct payload activity' and 'task 19 conduct payload activity' and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 24 sleep' and 'task 25 initialize day' and 'task 26 post sleep' and 'task 28 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 29 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 32 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 33 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 34 have meal' and 'task 35 exercise' and 'task 36 change filter' and 'task 37 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 1 conduct payload activity' and 'task 2 post sleep' and 'task 3 post sleep' and 'task 4 initialize day' and 'task 5 conduct payload activity' and 'task 6 conduct payload activity' and 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal' and 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 change filter' and 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 medical conference' and 'task 21 medical conference' and 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 24 conduct payload activity' and 'task 25 conduct payload activity' and 'task 26 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 28 conduct payload activity' and 'task 29 conduct payload activity' and 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'.
