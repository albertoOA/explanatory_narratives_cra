·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is plan with equal cost than and is plan with less tasks than and is plan with equal expected makespan than Plan_B. Plan_A includes task task_5_first_reconfigurate_thermal_loops and task_6_remove_sleep_station and task_7_replace_rpcm and task_8_assemble_sleep_station and task_9_second_reconfigurate_thermal_loops and task_10_sleep and task_11_finish_rpcm; while Plan_B includes task task_5_conduct_payload_activity and task_6_conduct_payload_activity and task_7_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_8_conduct_payload_activity and task_9_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_10_conduct_payload_activity and task_11_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_12_conduct_payload_activity and task_13_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_14_conduct_payload_activity and task_15_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_16_conduct_payload_activity and task_17_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_18_sleep and task_19_report_payload_activity_at_deadline. Plan_A has expected makespan Plan_A_makespan, which has the same value as Plan_B_makespan; while Plan_B has expected makespan Plan_B_makespan. Plan_A has number of tasks Plan_A_number_of_tasks, which has a lower value than Plan_B_number_of_tasks; while Plan_B has number of tasks Plan_B_number_of_tasks. Plan_A has cost Plan_A_cost; while Plan_B has cost Plan_B_cost, which has the same value as Plan_A_cost.
