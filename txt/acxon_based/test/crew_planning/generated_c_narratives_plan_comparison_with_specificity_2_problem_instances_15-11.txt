·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is shorter plan than and is slower plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 0 conduct payload activity' and 'task 2 initialize day' and 'task 3 conduct payload activity' and 'task 4 conduct payload activity' and 'task 6 exercise' and 'task 7 change filter' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 conduct payload activity' and 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 12 first reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 13 remove sleep station' and 'task 14 replace rpcm' and 'task 15 assemble sleep station' and 'task 16 second reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 17 finish rpcm' and 'task 18 sleep' and 'task 19 initialize day' and 'task 20 post sleep' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 25 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 27 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 28 have meal' and 'task 29 exercise' and 'task 30 change filter' and 'task 31 medical conference' and 'task 32 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 initialize day' and 'task 2 post sleep' and 'task 3 post sleep' and 'task 4 have meal' and 'task 6 have meal' and 'task 7 exercise' and 'task 8 exercise' and 'task 9 exercise' and 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 sleep' and 'task 12 medical conference' and 'task 13 medical conference' and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 19 conduct payload activity' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 25 conduct payload activity' and 'task 27 conduct payload activity' and 'task 28 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 29 conduct payload activity' and 'task 30 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 31 conduct payload activity' and 'task 32 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 33 conduct payload activity' and 'task 34 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 35 conduct payload activity' and 'task 36 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 37 conduct payload activity' and 'task 38 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 39 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 40 first reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 41 remove sleep station' and 'task 42 replace rpcm' and 'task 43 assemble sleep station' and 'task 44 second reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 45 sleep' and 'task 46 finish rpcm'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'.
