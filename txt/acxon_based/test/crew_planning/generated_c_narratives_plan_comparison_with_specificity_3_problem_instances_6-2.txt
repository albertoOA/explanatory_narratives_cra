·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is plan with same cost as and is longer plan than and is slower plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 0 conduct payload activity' and 'task 1 conduct payload activity' and 'task 2 post sleep' and 'task 3 post sleep' and 'task 4 initialize day' and 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal' and 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 medical conference' and 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 25 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 26 sleep' and 'task 27 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 initialize day' and 'task 1 post sleep' and 'task 2 have meal' and 'task 3 exercise' and 'task 4 medical conference' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 12 sleep'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has the same value as 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '616.01', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '1035.01'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '14.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '28.0'. 'task 0 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 5 conduct payload activity', and 'task 6 conduct payload activity', and 'task 1 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 5 conduct payload activity', and 'task 6 conduct payload activity', and 'task 2 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 15 have meal', and also directly precedes 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 3 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 15 have meal', and also directly precedes 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 15 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise', and 'task 18 medical conference', and 'task 16 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise', and 'task 18 medical conference', and 'task 17 exercise' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise', and 'task 20 conduct payload activity', and 'task 18 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise', and 'task 20 conduct payload activity', and 'task 19 exercise' directly precedes 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 22 conduct payload activity', and also directly precedes 'task 23 conduct payload activity', and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 22 conduct payload activity', and also directly precedes 'task 23 conduct payload activity', and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 25 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 26 sleep', and also directly precedes 'task 27 sleep', and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 25 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 26 sleep', and also directly precedes 'task 27 sleep', and 'task 1 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 2 have meal', and 'task 2 have meal' directly precedes 'task 3 exercise', and 'task 3 exercise' directly precedes 'task 4 medical conference', and 'task 10 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 12 sleep'.
