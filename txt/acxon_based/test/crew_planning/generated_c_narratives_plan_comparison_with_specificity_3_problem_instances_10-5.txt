·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is cheaper plan than and is shorter plan than and is faster plan than and is better plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 0 conduct payload activity', which directly precedes 'task 5 conduct payload activity' and 'task 6 conduct payload activity', and also includes task 'task 1 conduct payload activity' and 'task 4 initialize day' and 'task 5 conduct payload activity' and 'task 6 conduct payload activity' and 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal' and 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 medical conference' and 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 sleep' and 'task 21 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 initialize day' and 'task 1 post sleep' and 'task 4 have meal' and 'task 5 have meal' and 'task 6 have meal' and 'task 7 exercise' and 'task 8 exercise' and 'task 9 exercise' and 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 sleep' and 'task 12 medical conference' and 'task 13 medical conference' and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 19 conduct payload activity' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' and 'task 22 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 25 conduct payload activity' and 'task 26 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 27 conduct payload activity' and 'task 28 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 29 conduct payload activity' and 'task 30 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 31 conduct payload activity' and 'task 32 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 33 conduct payload activity' and 'task 34 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 35 conduct payload activity' and 'task 36 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 37 conduct payload activity' and 'task 38 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 39 conduct payload activity' and 'task 40 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 41 sleep' and 'task 42 report payload activity at deadline'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a lower value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a lower value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has a lower value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'task 5 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity', while 'task 1 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 5 conduct payload activity', while 'task 6 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '1276.02', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '975.0'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '43.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '22.0'. 'Plan B cost' has value '1875.02', while 'Plan A cost' has value '1440.0'. 'task 1 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 6 conduct payload activity', and 'task 15 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 medical conference', and 'task 16 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 medical conference', and 'task 17 exercise' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 sleep', and 'task 18 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 sleep', and 'task 19 exercise' directly precedes 'task 21 sleep', and 'task 7 exercise' directly precedes 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 sleep' and 'task 12 medical conference', and 'task 8 exercise' directly precedes 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 sleep' and 'task 12 medical conference', and 'task 9 exercise' directly precedes 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 sleep' and 'task 12 medical conference', and 'task 12 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 13 medical conference', and 'task 13 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 14 conduct payload activity', and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 15 conduct payload activity' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 17 conduct payload activity' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 19 conduct payload activity' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 19 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 21 conduct payload activity' and 'task 22 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 25 conduct payload activity' and 'task 26 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 25 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 27 conduct payload activity' and 'task 28 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 27 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 29 conduct payload activity' and 'task 30 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 29 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 31 conduct payload activity' and 'task 32 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 31 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 33 conduct payload activity' and 'task 34 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 33 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 35 conduct payload activity' and 'task 36 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 35 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 37 conduct payload activity' and 'task 38 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 37 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 39 conduct payload activity' and 'task 40 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 39 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 41 sleep' and 'task 42 report payload activity at deadline'.
