·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is longer plan than and is slower plan than and is worse plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 1 post sleep', which directly precedes 'task 5 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 6 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 8 have meal', and also includes task 'task 2 initialize day' and 'task 3 conduct payload activity' and 'task 4 conduct payload activity' and 'task 5 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 6 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 8 have meal' and 'task 9 exercise' and 'task 10 medical conference' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 13 conduct payload activity' and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' and 'task 16 conduct payload activity' and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' and 'task 18 conduct payload activity' and 'task 19 sleep' and 'task 20 post sleep' and 'task 21 initialize day' and 'task 22 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 26 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 27 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 28 have meal' and 'task 29 exercise' and 'task 30 change filter' and 'task 31 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 1 conduct payload activity' and 'task 2 post sleep' and 'task 3 post sleep' and 'task 4 initialize day' and 'task 5 conduct payload activity' and 'task 6 conduct payload activity' and 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal' and 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 medical conference' and 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 26 sleep' and 'task 27 sleep'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has a higher value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'task 20 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 22 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 25 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 26 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 27 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 28 have meal', while 'task 2 initialize day' directly precedes 'task 20 post sleep'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '1035.01', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '2415.01'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '28.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '32.0'. 'Plan B cost' has value '1440.0', while 'Plan A cost' has value '2880.0'. 'task 2 initialize day' directly precedes 'task 21 initialize day', and 'task 3 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 4 conduct payload activity', and 'task 8 have meal' directly precedes 'task 9 exercise', and 'task 9 exercise' directly precedes 'task 10 medical conference', and 'task 10 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 11 conduct payload activity', and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 conduct payload activity', and 'task 13 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 14 conduct payload activity', and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 15 conduct payload activity', and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 16 conduct payload activity', and 'task 16 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 17 conduct payload activity', and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 18 conduct payload activity', and 'task 18 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 19 sleep', and 'task 28 have meal' directly precedes 'task 29 exercise', and 'task 29 exercise' directly precedes 'task 30 change filter', and 'task 30 change filter' directly precedes 'task 31 sleep', and 'task 2 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 3 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 15 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 medical conference', and 'task 16 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 medical conference', and 'task 17 exercise' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 conduct payload activity', and 'task 18 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 conduct payload activity', and 'task 19 exercise' directly precedes 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity', and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity', and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 26 sleep' and 'task 27 sleep', and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 26 sleep' and 'task 27 sleep'.
