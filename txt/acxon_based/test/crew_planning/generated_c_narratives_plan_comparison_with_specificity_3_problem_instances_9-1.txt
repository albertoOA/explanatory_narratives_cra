·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is plan with same cost as and is longer plan than and is slower plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 0 conduct payload activity', which directly precedes 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 conduct payload activity', and also includes task 'task 1 conduct payload activity' and 'task 2 conduct payload activity' and 'task 3 post sleep' and 'task 4 post sleep' and 'task 5 post sleep' and 'task 6 initialize day' and 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 conduct payload activity' and 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 12 conduct payload activity' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 19 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 have meal' and 'task 23 have meal' and 'task 24 have meal' and 'task 25 exercise' and 'task 26 exercise' and 'task 27 change filter' and 'task 28 exercise' and 'task 29 medical conference' and 'task 30 medical conference' and 'task 31 sleep' and 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 initialize day' and 'task 1 post sleep' and 'task 2 have meal' and 'task 3 exercise' and 'task 4 change filter' and 'task 5 first reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 6 remove sleep station' and 'task 7 replace rpcm' and 'task 8 assemble sleep station' and 'task 9 second reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 finish rpcm'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has the same value as 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'task 7 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 12 conduct payload activity', while 'task 1 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 7 conduct payload activity', while 'task 8 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 12 conduct payload activity', while 'task 9 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 12 conduct payload activity'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '796.01', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '975.0'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '12.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '34.0'. 'task 1 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 conduct payload activity', and 'task 2 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 conduct payload activity', and 'task 3 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 19 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 have meal' and 'task 23 have meal' and 'task 24 have meal', and 'task 4 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 19 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 have meal' and 'task 23 have meal' and 'task 24 have meal', and 'task 5 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 18 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 19 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 20 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 21 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 22 have meal' and 'task 23 have meal' and 'task 24 have meal', and 'task 22 have meal' directly precedes 'task 25 exercise' and 'task 26 exercise' and 'task 27 change filter', and 'task 23 have meal' directly precedes 'task 25 exercise' and 'task 26 exercise' and 'task 27 change filter', and 'task 24 have meal' directly precedes 'task 25 exercise' and 'task 26 exercise' and 'task 27 change filter', and 'task 25 exercise' directly precedes 'task 28 exercise' and 'task 29 medical conference' and 'task 30 medical conference', and 'task 26 exercise' directly precedes 'task 28 exercise' and 'task 29 medical conference' and 'task 30 medical conference', and 'task 27 change filter' directly precedes 'task 28 exercise' and 'task 29 medical conference' and 'task 30 medical conference', and 'task 28 exercise' directly precedes 'task 31 sleep' and 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep', and 'task 29 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 31 sleep' and 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep', and 'task 30 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 31 sleep' and 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep', and 'task 1 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 2 have meal', and 'task 2 have meal' directly precedes 'task 3 exercise', and 'task 3 exercise' directly precedes 'task 4 change filter', and 'task 4 change filter' directly precedes 'task 5 first reconfigurate thermal loops', and 'task 5 first reconfigurate thermal loops' directly precedes 'task 6 remove sleep station', and 'task 6 remove sleep station' directly precedes 'task 7 replace rpcm', and 'task 7 replace rpcm' directly precedes 'task 8 assemble sleep station', and 'task 8 assemble sleep station' directly precedes 'task 9 second reconfigurate thermal loops', and 'task 9 second reconfigurate thermal loops' directly precedes 'task 10 sleep' and 'task 11 finish rpcm'.
