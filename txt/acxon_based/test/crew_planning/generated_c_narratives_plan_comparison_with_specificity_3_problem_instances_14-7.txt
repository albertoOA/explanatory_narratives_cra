·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is longer plan than and is slower plan than and is worse plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 1 post sleep', which directly precedes 'task 5 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 6 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 8 have meal', and also includes task 'task 2 initialize day' and 'task 3 conduct payload activity' and 'task 4 conduct payload activity' and 'task 5 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 6 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 8 have meal' and 'task 9 exercise' and 'task 10 change filter' and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' and 'task 13 conduct payload activity' and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' and 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' and 'task 18 conduct payload activity' and 'task 19 conduct payload activity' and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' and 'task 24 sleep' and 'task 25 initialize day' and 'task 26 post sleep' and 'task 28 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 29 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 32 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 33 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 34 have meal' and 'task 35 exercise' and 'task 36 change filter' and 'task 37 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 1 conduct payload activity' and 'task 2 post sleep' and 'task 3 post sleep' and 'task 4 initialize day' and 'task 5 conduct payload activity' and 'task 6 conduct payload activity' and 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 8 conduct payload activity' and 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal' and 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 change filter' and 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 medical conference' and 'task 21 medical conference' and 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 24 conduct payload activity' and 'task 25 conduct payload activity' and 'task 26 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 28 conduct payload activity' and 'task 29 conduct payload activity' and 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has a higher value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '1155.01', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '2550.02'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '34.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '38.0'. 'Plan B cost' has value '1440.0', while 'Plan A cost' has value '2880.0'. 'task 2 initialize day' directly precedes 'task 25 initialize day', and 'task 3 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 4 conduct payload activity', and 'task 8 have meal' directly precedes 'task 9 exercise', and 'task 9 exercise' directly precedes 'task 10 change filter', and 'task 10 change filter' directly precedes 'task 11 conduct payload activity', and 'task 11 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 conduct payload activity', and 'task 13 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 conduct payload activity', and 'task 15 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 16 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 17 conduct payload activity', and 'task 17 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 18 conduct payload activity', and 'task 18 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 19 conduct payload activity', and 'task 19 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 20 conduct payload activity', and 'task 20 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 21 conduct payload activity', and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 22 conduct payload activity', and 'task 23 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 24 sleep', and 'task 24 sleep' directly precedes 'task 26 post sleep', and 'task 26 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 27 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 28 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 29 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 30 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 31 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 32 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 33 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 34 have meal', and 'task 34 have meal' directly precedes 'task 35 exercise', and 'task 35 exercise' directly precedes 'task 36 change filter', and 'task 36 change filter' directly precedes 'task 37 sleep', and 'task 2 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 3 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 15 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 change filter', and 'task 16 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 change filter', and 'task 17 exercise' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 medical conference', and 'task 18 change filter' directly precedes 'task 19 exercise' and 'task 20 medical conference', and 'task 19 exercise' directly precedes 'task 21 medical conference', and 'task 20 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 21 medical conference', and 'task 28 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep', and 'task 29 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 32 sleep' and 'task 33 sleep'.
