·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is plan with same cost as and is longer plan than and is slower plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 0 conduct payload activity' and 'task 1 conduct payload activity' and 'task 2 post sleep' and 'task 3 post sleep' and 'task 4 initialize day' and 'task 7 conduct payload activity' and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 15 have meal' and 'task 16 have meal' and 'task 17 exercise' and 'task 18 exercise' and 'task 19 change filter' and 'task 20 medical conference' and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' and 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 25 first reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 26 remove sleep station' and 'task 27 replace rpcm' and 'task 28 assemble sleep station' and 'task 29 second reconfigurate thermal loops' and 'task 30 finish rpcm' and 'task 31 sleep' and 'task 32 sleep'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 initialize day' and 'task 1 post sleep' and 'task 2 have meal' and 'task 3 exercise' and 'task 4 change filter' and 'task 7 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 10 conduct payload activity' and 'task 12 conduct payload activity' and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' and 'task 15 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 16 conduct payload activity' and 'task 17 report payload activity at deadline' and 'task 18 sleep' and 'task 19 report payload activity at deadline'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has the same value as 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '796.01', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '1335.01'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '20.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '33.0'. 'task 0 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 5 conduct payload activity', and 'task 6 conduct payload activity', and 'task 1 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 5 conduct payload activity', and 'task 6 conduct payload activity', and 'task 2 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 15 have meal', and also directly precedes 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 3 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 9 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 10 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 11 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 12 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 13 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 14 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 15 have meal', and also directly precedes 'task 16 have meal', and 'task 15 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise', and 'task 18 exercise', and 'task 16 have meal' directly precedes 'task 17 exercise', and 'task 18 exercise', and 'task 17 exercise' directly precedes 'task 19 change filter', and 'task 20 medical conference', and 'task 18 exercise' directly precedes 'task 19 change filter', and 'task 20 medical conference', and 'task 19 change filter' directly precedes 'task 21 conduct payload activity', and 'task 22 conduct payload activity', and 'task 20 medical conference' directly precedes 'task 21 conduct payload activity', and 'task 22 conduct payload activity', and 'task 21 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 25 first reconfigurate thermal loops', and also directly precedes 'task 26 remove sleep station', and 'task 22 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 23 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 24 report payload activity at deadline', and also directly precedes 'task 25 first reconfigurate thermal loops', and also directly precedes 'task 26 remove sleep station', and 'task 25 first reconfigurate thermal loops' directly precedes 'task 27 replace rpcm', and 'task 26 remove sleep station' directly precedes 'task 27 replace rpcm', and 'task 27 replace rpcm' directly precedes 'task 28 assemble sleep station', and 'task 29 second reconfigurate thermal loops', and 'task 28 assemble sleep station' directly precedes 'task 30 finish rpcm', and 'task 31 sleep', and also directly precedes 'task 32 sleep', and 'task 29 second reconfigurate thermal loops' directly precedes 'task 30 finish rpcm', and 'task 31 sleep', and also directly precedes 'task 32 sleep', and 'task 1 post sleep' directly precedes 'task 2 have meal', and 'task 2 have meal' directly precedes 'task 3 exercise', and 'task 3 exercise' directly precedes 'task 4 change filter', and 'task 10 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 12 conduct payload activity', and 'task 12 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 14 conduct payload activity', and 'task 15 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 14 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 16 conduct payload activity', and 'task 17 report payload activity at deadline', and 'task 16 conduct payload activity' directly precedes 'task 18 sleep', and 'task 19 report payload activity at deadline'.
