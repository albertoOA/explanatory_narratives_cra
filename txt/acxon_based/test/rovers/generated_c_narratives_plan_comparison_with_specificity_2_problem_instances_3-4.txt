·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is more expensive plan than and is plan with more tasks than and is slower plan than Plan_B. Plan_A includes task task_0_navigate and task_1_navigate and task_2_calibrate and task_3_sample_rock and task_4_take_image and task_5_navigate and task_6_navigate and task_7_navigate and task_8_communicate_image_data and task_9_sample_soil and task_10_communicate_soil_data and task_11_communicate_rock_data; while Plan_B includes task task_0_calibrate and task_1_sample_soil and task_2_navigate and task_3_take_image and task_4_communicate_soil_data and task_5_sample_rock and task_6_communicate_rock_data and task_7_communicate_image_data. Plan_A has expected makespan Plan_A_makespan, which has a higher value than Plan_B_makespan; while Plan_B has expected makespan Plan_B_makespan. Plan_A has number of tasks Plan_A_number_of_tasks, which has a higher value than Plan_B_number_of_tasks; while Plan_B has number of tasks Plan_B_number_of_tasks. Plan_A has cost Plan_A_cost, which has a higher value than Plan_B_cost; while Plan_B has cost Plan_B_cost.
