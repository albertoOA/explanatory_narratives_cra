·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is shorter plan than and is slower plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 0 calibrate' and 'task 1 sample rock' and 'task 3 take image' and 'task 4 navigate' and 'task 5 calibrate' and 'task 6 drop' and 'task 7 sample soil' and 'task 8 communicate image data' and 'task 9 take image' and 'task 10 calibrate' and 'task 11 take image' and 'task 13 drop' and 'task 15 communicate image data' and 'task 16 communicate image data' and 'task 17 communicate rock data' and 'task 18 navigate' and 'task 19 sample rock' and 'task 21 communicate rock data' and 'task 22 communicate soil data' and 'task 23 navigate' and 'task 24 sample soil' and 'task 26 communicate soil data'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 0 sample soil' and 'task 1 calibrate' and 'task 3 navigate' and 'task 4 take image' and 'task 5 navigate' and 'task 6 sample rock' and 'task 7 calibrate' and 'task 8 navigate' and 'task 9 drop' and 'task 10 sample soil' and 'task 11 navigate' and 'task 13 communicate soil data' and 'task 15 navigate' and 'task 16 drop' and 'task 17 take image' and 'task 18 calibrate' and 'task 19 communicate image data' and 'task 21 take image' and 'task 22 navigate' and 'task 23 sample soil' and 'task 24 communicate image data' and 'task 26 navigate' and 'task 27 communicate image data' and 'task 28 navigate' and 'task 29 communicate soil data' and 'task 30 navigate' and 'task 31 navigate' and 'task 32 communicate soil data' and 'task 33 navigate' and 'task 34 sample rock' and 'task 35 communicate rock data' and 'task 36 navigate' and 'task 37 communicate rock data'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'.
