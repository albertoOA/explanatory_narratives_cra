·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is more expensive plan than and is plan with more tasks than and is slower plan than Plan_B. Plan_A includes task task_2_sample_rock, which directly precedes task_13_navigate, and also includes task task_3_calibrate, which directly precedes task_8_take_image, and also includes task task_5_calibrate, which directly precedes task_8_take_image, and also includes task task_7_take_image and task_9_take_image and task_10_sample_soil, which directly precedes task_17_drop, and also includes task task_11_navigate and task_12_calibrate and task_14_communicate_soil_data, which directly precedes task_20_sample_soil, and also includes task task_15_sample_rock and task_16_navigate, which directly precedes task_20_sample_soil, and also includes task task_18_navigate and task_19_communicate_rock_data and task_21_navigate and task_22_communicate_image_data and task_23_drop and task_24_sample_rock and task_25_navigate, which directly precedes task_27_sample_rock, and also includes task task_26_drop and task_28_communicate_image_data and task_29_navigate and task_30_drop and task_31_navigate and task_32_communicate_image_data and task_33_sample_soil and task_34_navigate and task_35_communicate_soil_data and task_36_communicate_soil_data and task_37_communicate_soil_data and task_38_communicate_rock_data and task_39_communicate_rock_data and task_40_communicate_rock_data; while Plan_B includes task task_2_navigate, which directly precedes task_4_calibrate, and also includes task task_3_sample_soil and task_5_sample_rock and task_7_drop and task_9_navigate and task_10_drop and task_11_communicate_image_data and task_12_sample_soil, which directly precedes task_13_navigate, and also includes task task_14_drop and task_15_communicate_soil_data and task_16_sample_rock, which directly precedes task_17_drop, and also includes task task_18_communicate_soil_data and task_19_navigate, which directly precedes task_20_sample_soil, and also includes task task_21_communicate_soil_data and task_22_navigate and task_23_communicate_rock_data and task_24_communicate_soil_data and task_25_communicate_rock_data and task_26_navigate, which directly precedes task_27_sample_rock, and also includes task task_28_navigate and task_29_drop and task_30_communicate_rock_data and task_31_sample_rock and task_32_communicate_rock_data. Plan_A has expected makespan Plan_A_makespan, which has a higher value than Plan_B_makespan; while Plan_B has expected makespan Plan_B_makespan. Plan_A has number of tasks Plan_A_number_of_tasks, which has a higher value than Plan_B_number_of_tasks; while Plan_B has number of tasks Plan_B_number_of_tasks. Plan_A has cost Plan_A_cost, which has a higher value than Plan_B_cost; while Plan_B has cost Plan_B_cost.
