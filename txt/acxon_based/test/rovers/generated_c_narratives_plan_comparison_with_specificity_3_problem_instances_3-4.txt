·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is more expensive plan than and is plan with more tasks than and is slower plan than Plan_B. Plan_A includes task task_0_navigate, which directly precedes task_2_calibrate and task_3_sample_rock, and also includes task task_1_navigate, which directly precedes task_2_calibrate and task_3_sample_rock, and also includes task task_2_calibrate, which directly precedes task_4_take_image, and also includes task task_3_sample_rock, which directly precedes task_5_navigate, and also includes task task_4_take_image, which directly precedes task_6_navigate, and also includes task task_5_navigate and task_6_navigate, which directly precedes task_7_navigate, and also includes task task_7_navigate, which directly precedes task_8_communicate_image_data and task_9_sample_soil, and also includes task task_8_communicate_image_data, which directly precedes task_10_communicate_soil_data, and also includes task task_9_sample_soil and task_10_communicate_soil_data, which directly precedes task_11_communicate_rock_data, and also includes task task_11_communicate_rock_data; while Plan_B includes task task_0_calibrate, which directly precedes task_2_navigate, and also includes task task_1_sample_soil, which directly precedes task_3_take_image and task_4_communicate_soil_data and task_5_sample_rock, and also includes task task_2_navigate, which directly precedes task_3_take_image and task_4_communicate_soil_data and task_5_sample_rock, and also includes task task_3_take_image and task_4_communicate_soil_data, which directly precedes task_6_communicate_rock_data, and also includes task task_5_sample_rock and task_6_communicate_rock_data, which directly precedes task_7_communicate_image_data, and also includes task task_7_communicate_image_data. Plan_A has expected makespan Plan_A_makespan, which has a higher value than Plan_B_makespan and has value 62.01; while Plan_B has expected makespan Plan_B_makespan, which has value 45.0. Plan_A has number of tasks Plan_A_number_of_tasks, which has a higher value than Plan_B_number_of_tasks and has value 12.0; while Plan_B has number of tasks Plan_B_number_of_tasks, which has value 8.0. Plan_A has cost Plan_A_cost, which has a higher value than Plan_B_cost and has value 62.01; while Plan_B has cost Plan_B_cost, which has value 45.0.
