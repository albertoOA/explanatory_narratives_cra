·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is longer plan than and is slower plan than and is worse plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 3 calibrate' and 'task 4 sample soil' and 'task 5 take image' and 'task 6 take image' and 'task 7 calibrate' and 'task 8 calibrate' and 'task 9 take image' and 'task 10 navigate' and 'task 11 navigate' and 'task 12 navigate' and 'task 13 drop' and 'task 14 communicate image data' and 'task 15 sample rock' and 'task 16 sample soil' and 'task 17 navigate' and 'task 18 drop' and 'task 19 navigate' and 'task 20 navigate' and 'task 21 navigate' and 'task 22 communicate soil data' and 'task 23 sample soil' and 'task 24 communicate soil data' and 'task 25 navigate' and 'task 26 communicate image data' and 'task 27 communicate soil data' and 'task 28 communicate rock data' and 'task 29 navigate' and 'task 30 sample rock' and 'task 31 navigate' and 'task 32 drop' and 'task 33 communicate rock data' and 'task 34 navigate' and 'task 35 navigate' and 'task 36 sample rock' and 'task 37 communicate rock data'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 3 sample rock' and 'task 4 take image' and 'task 5 navigate' and 'task 6 navigate' and 'task 7 navigate' and 'task 8 communicate image data' and 'task 9 sample soil' and 'task 10 communicate soil data' and 'task 11 communicate rock data'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'.
