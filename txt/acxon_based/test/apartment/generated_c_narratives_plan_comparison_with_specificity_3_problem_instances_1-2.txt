·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is cheaper plan than and is shorter plan than and is faster plan than and is better plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 2 grasp object', which directly precedes 'task 3 goto waypoint', and also includes task 'task 3 goto waypoint' and 'task 5 give object'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 2 goto waypoint' and 'task 3 grasp object' and 'task 5 goto waypoint' and 'task 6 goto waypoint' and 'task 7 give object'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a lower value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a lower value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has a lower value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '59.0', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '27.0'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '8.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '6.0'. 'Plan B cost' has value '59.0', while 'Plan A cost' has value '27.0'. 'task 3 goto waypoint' directly precedes 'task 5 give object', and 'task 2 goto waypoint' directly precedes 'task 5 goto waypoint', and 'task 6 goto waypoint' directly precedes 'task 7 give object'.
