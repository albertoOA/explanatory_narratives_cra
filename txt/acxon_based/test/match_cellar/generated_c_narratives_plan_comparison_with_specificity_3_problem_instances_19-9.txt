·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is longer plan than and is slower plan than and is worse plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 38 mend fuse' and 'task 39 light match' and 'task 41 mend fuse' and 'task 42 light match' and 'task 43 mend fuse' and 'task 44 mend fuse' and 'task 45 light match' and 'task 46 mend fuse' and 'task 47 mend fuse' and 'task 48 light match' and 'task 49 mend fuse' and 'task 50 mend fuse' and 'task 51 light match' and 'task 52 mend fuse' and 'task 53 light match' and 'task 54 mend fuse' and 'task 55 mend fuse'; while 'Plan B' includes task 'task 38 light match' and 'task 39 mend fuse'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has a higher value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '54.03', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '74.04'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '41.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '56.0'. 'Plan B cost' has value '54.03', while 'Plan A cost' has value '74.04'. 'task 38 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 40 mend fuse', and 'task 39 light match' directly precedes 'task 43 mend fuse', and 'task 41 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 43 mend fuse', and 'task 42 light match' directly precedes 'task 46 mend fuse', and 'task 43 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 44 mend fuse', and 'task 44 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 46 mend fuse', and 'task 45 light match' directly precedes 'task 49 mend fuse', and 'task 46 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 47 mend fuse', and 'task 47 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 49 mend fuse', and 'task 48 light match' directly precedes 'task 52 mend fuse', and 'task 49 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 50 mend fuse', and 'task 50 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 52 mend fuse', and 'task 51 light match' directly precedes 'task 55 mend fuse', and 'task 52 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 54 mend fuse', and 'task 54 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 55 mend fuse'.
