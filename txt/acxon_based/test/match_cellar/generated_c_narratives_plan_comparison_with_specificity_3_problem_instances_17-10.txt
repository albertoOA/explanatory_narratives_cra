·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

'Plan A' is more expensive plan than and is longer plan than and is slower plan than and is worse plan than 'Plan B'. 'Plan A' includes task 'task 42 light match', which directly precedes 'task 46 mend fuse', and also includes task 'task 43 mend fuse' and 'task 44 mend fuse' and 'task 45 light match' and 'task 46 mend fuse' and 'task 47 mend fuse' and 'task 48 light match' and 'task 49 mend fuse' and 'task 50 light match' and 'task 51 mend fuse' and 'task 52 mend fuse'. 'Plan A' has expected makespan 'Plan A makespan', which has a higher value than 'Plan B makespan'; while 'Plan B' has expected makespan 'Plan B makespan'. 'Plan A' has number of tasks 'Plan A number of tasks', which has a higher value than 'Plan B number of tasks'; while 'Plan B' has number of tasks 'Plan B number of tasks'. 'Plan A' has cost 'Plan A cost', which has a higher value than 'Plan B cost'; while 'Plan B' has cost 'Plan B cost'. 'Plan B makespan' has value '56.03', while 'Plan A makespan' has value '70.04'. 'Plan B number of tasks' has value '42.0', while 'Plan A number of tasks' has value '53.0'. 'Plan B cost' has value '56.03', while 'Plan A cost' has value '70.03'. 'task 42 light match' is a type of 'Task', while 'task 46 mend fuse' is a type of 'Task'. 'task 43 mend fuse' is a type of 'Task', while 'task 44 mend fuse' is a type of 'Task'. 'task 44 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 46 mend fuse', while 'task 43 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 44 mend fuse'. 'task 45 light match' is a type of 'Task', while 'task 49 mend fuse' is a type of 'Task'. 'task 49 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 51 mend fuse', while 'task 45 light match' directly precedes 'task 49 mend fuse'. 'task 47 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 49 mend fuse', while 'task 46 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 47 mend fuse'. 'task 52 mend fuse' is a type of 'Task', and 'task 51 mend fuse' is a type of 'Task', and 'task 50 light match' is a type of 'Task', and 'task 48 light match' is a type of 'Task', and 'task 47 mend fuse' is a type of 'Task'. 'task 48 light match' directly precedes 'task 52 mend fuse', and 'task 51 mend fuse' directly precedes 'task 52 mend fuse'.
