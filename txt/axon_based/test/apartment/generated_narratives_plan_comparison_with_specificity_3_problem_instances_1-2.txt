·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_find_person and task_1_goto_waypoint and task_2_grasp_object and task_3_goto_waypoint and task_4_goto_waypoint and task_5_give_object and is cheaper plan than Plan_B and is plan with less tasks than Plan_B and is faster plan than Plan_B. 

Plan_A_makespan is a type of Quality and is expected makespan of Plan_A and has data value 27.0 and has a lower value than Plan_B_makespan. 

Plan_A_number_of_tasks is a type of Quality and is number of tasks of Plan_A and has data value 6.0 and has a lower value than Plan_B_number_of_tasks. 

Plan_A_cost is a type of Quality and is cost of Plan_A and has data value 27.0 and has a lower value than Plan_B_cost. 

Plan_B is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_find_person and task_1_goto_waypoint and task_4_goto_waypoint and task_2_goto_waypoint and task_3_grasp_object and task_5_goto_waypoint and task_6_goto_waypoint and task_7_give_object. 

task_0_find_person is a type of Task and directly precedes task_4_goto_waypoint and task_2_goto_waypoint. 

task_1_goto_waypoint is a type of Task and directly precedes task_2_grasp_object and task_3_grasp_object. 

task_2_grasp_object is a type of Task and directly precedes task_3_goto_waypoint. 

task_3_goto_waypoint is a type of Task and directly precedes task_5_give_object. 

task_4_goto_waypoint is a type of Task and directly precedes task_6_goto_waypoint. 

task_3_grasp_object directly precedes task_4_goto_waypoint. 

task_5_give_object is a type of Task. 

Plan_B_makespan is expected makespan of Plan_B. 

Plan_B_number_of_tasks is number of tasks of Plan_B. 

Plan_B_cost is cost of Plan_B. 


Plan_B is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_find_person and task_1_goto_waypoint and task_2_goto_waypoint and task_3_grasp_object and task_4_goto_waypoint and task_5_goto_waypoint and task_6_goto_waypoint and task_7_give_object and is more expensive plan than Plan_A and is plan with more tasks than Plan_A and is slower plan than Plan_A. 

Plan_B_makespan is a type of Quality and is expected makespan of Plan_B and has data value 59.0 and has a higher value than Plan_A_makespan. 

Plan_B_number_of_tasks is a type of Quality and is number of tasks of Plan_B and has data value 8.0 and has a higher value than Plan_A_number_of_tasks. 

Plan_B_cost is a type of Quality and is cost of Plan_B and has data value 59.0 and has a higher value than Plan_A_cost. 

Plan_A is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_find_person and task_1_goto_waypoint and task_4_goto_waypoint and task_2_grasp_object and task_3_goto_waypoint and task_5_give_object. 

task_0_find_person is a type of Task and directly precedes task_4_goto_waypoint and task_2_goto_waypoint. 

task_1_goto_waypoint is a type of Task and directly precedes task_2_grasp_object and task_3_grasp_object. 

task_2_goto_waypoint is a type of Task and directly precedes task_5_goto_waypoint. 

task_3_grasp_object is a type of Task and directly precedes task_4_goto_waypoint. 

task_4_goto_waypoint is a type of Task and directly precedes task_6_goto_waypoint.
