·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_initialize_day and task_1_post_sleep and task_2_have_meal and task_3_exercise and task_4_change_filter and task_5_first_reconfigurate_thermal_loops and task_6_remove_sleep_station and task_7_replace_rpcm and task_8_assemble_sleep_station and task_9_second_reconfigurate_thermal_loops and task_10_sleep and task_11_finish_rpcm and is plan with equal cost than Plan_B and is plan with less tasks than Plan_B and is slower plan than Plan_B. 

Plan_A_makespan is expected makespan of Plan_A. 

Plan_A_number_of_tasks is number of tasks of Plan_A. 

Plan_A_cost is cost of Plan_A. 


Plan_B is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_initialize_day and task_1_post_sleep and task_2_have_meal and task_3_exercise and task_4_medical_conference and task_5_conduct_payload_activity and task_6_conduct_payload_activity and task_7_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_8_conduct_payload_activity and task_9_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_10_conduct_payload_activity and task_11_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_12_sleep and task_13_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and is plan with equal cost than Plan_A and is plan with more tasks than Plan_A and is faster plan than Plan_A. 

Plan_B_makespan is expected makespan of Plan_B. 

Plan_B_number_of_tasks is number of tasks of Plan_B. 

Plan_B_cost is cost of Plan_B.
