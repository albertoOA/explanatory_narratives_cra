·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_initialize_day and task_1_post_sleep and task_2_post_sleep and task_3_post_sleep and task_4_have_meal and task_5_have_meal and task_6_have_meal and task_7_exercise and task_8_exercise and task_9_exercise and task_10_sleep and task_11_sleep and task_12_medical_conference and task_13_medical_conference and task_14_conduct_payload_activity and task_15_conduct_payload_activity and task_16_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_17_conduct_payload_activity and task_18_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_19_conduct_payload_activity and task_20_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_21_conduct_payload_activity and task_22_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_23_conduct_payload_activity and task_24_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_25_conduct_payload_activity and task_26_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_27_conduct_payload_activity and task_28_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_29_conduct_payload_activity and task_30_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_31_conduct_payload_activity and task_32_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_33_conduct_payload_activity and task_34_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_35_conduct_payload_activity and task_36_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_37_conduct_payload_activity and task_38_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_39_conduct_payload_activity and task_40_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_41_sleep and task_42_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and is cheaper plan than Plan_B and is plan with less tasks than Plan_B and is faster plan than Plan_B. 

Plan_A_makespan is expected makespan of Plan_A. 

Plan_A_number_of_tasks is number of tasks of Plan_A. 

Plan_A_cost is cost of Plan_A. 


Plan_B is a type of Plan and includes task task_0_initialize_day and task_1_post_sleep and task_2_post_sleep and task_3_post_sleep and task_4_have_meal and task_5_have_meal and task_6_have_meal and task_7_exercise and task_8_exercise and task_9_exercise and task_10_sleep and task_11_sleep and task_12_medical_conference and task_13_medical_conference and task_14_conduct_payload_activity and task_15_conduct_payload_activity and task_16_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_17_conduct_payload_activity and task_18_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_19_conduct_payload_activity and task_20_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_21_conduct_payload_activity and task_22_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_23_conduct_payload_activity and task_24_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_25_conduct_payload_activity and task_26_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_27_conduct_payload_activity and task_28_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_29_conduct_payload_activity and task_30_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_31_conduct_payload_activity and task_32_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_33_conduct_payload_activity and task_34_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_35_conduct_payload_activity and task_36_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_37_conduct_payload_activity and task_38_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_39_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_40_first_reconfigurate_thermal_loops and task_41_remove_sleep_station and task_42_replace_rpcm and task_43_assemble_sleep_station and task_44_second_reconfigurate_thermal_loops and task_45_sleep and task_46_finish_rpcm and is more expensive plan than Plan_A and is plan with more tasks than Plan_A and is slower plan than Plan_A. 

Plan_B_makespan is expected makespan of Plan_B. 

Plan_B_number_of_tasks is number of tasks of Plan_B. 

Plan_B_cost is cost of Plan_B.
