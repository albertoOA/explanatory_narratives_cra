·····There are two plans to disambiguate: Plan_A and Plan_B. 

Plan_A is cheaper plan than and is plan with less tasks than and is faster plan than Plan_B. Plan_A includes task task_39_conduct_payload_activity, which directly precedes task_41_sleep and task_42_report_payload_activity_at_deadline, and also includes task task_40_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_41_sleep and task_42_report_payload_activity_at_deadline; while Plan_B includes task task_39_report_payload_activity_at_deadline and task_40_first_reconfigurate_thermal_loops, which directly precedes task_41_remove_sleep_station, and also includes task task_41_remove_sleep_station, which directly precedes task_42_replace_rpcm, and also includes task task_42_replace_rpcm, which directly precedes task_43_assemble_sleep_station, and also includes task task_43_assemble_sleep_station, which directly precedes task_44_second_reconfigurate_thermal_loops, and also includes task task_44_second_reconfigurate_thermal_loops, which directly precedes task_45_sleep and task_46_finish_rpcm, and also includes task task_45_sleep and task_46_finish_rpcm. Plan_A has expected makespan Plan_A_makespan, which has value 1276.02 and has a lower value than Plan_B_makespan; while Plan_B has expected makespan Plan_B_makespan, which has value 1636.02. Plan_A has number of tasks Plan_A_number_of_tasks, which has value 43.0 and has a lower value than Plan_B_number_of_tasks; while Plan_B has number of tasks Plan_B_number_of_tasks, which has value 47.0. Plan_A has cost Plan_A_cost, which has value 1875.02 and has a lower value than Plan_B_cost; while Plan_B has cost Plan_B_cost, which has value 2235.02.
